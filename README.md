# Floppy Ant Controller

The Floppy Ant Controller is a control board for Antweight (150g) fighting robots. It implements many features and thanks to the ability to change settings without having to modify the code it makes it perfect for less experienced people.

Taking inspiration from the now well-known Malenki nano (https://github.com/MarkR42/malenki-nano.git), other features have been added, maintaining a small size and an affordable price.
## Features

- 3x DC motors driver (200 speed steps);
- 2x servo outputs (one of which can be selected with a soldering jumper if 5V or HV from the battery);
- 200Hz servo frequency;
- BEC 5V 3A max;
- 2x expansion ports with possible digital or analog readout (e.g. potentiometers, switches etc.);
- Support for 1 and 2s batteries;
- Batter voltage readout, with settable weapon speed limitation threshold & cutoff threshold (indipendent);
- Settings can be set via USB with dedicated software or serial terminal;
- 4 channels PWM, and 8 channels PPM compatibility;
- Dimensions of 23mm*33mm for a weight of 9g.
